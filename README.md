- 👋 Hi, I’m @DavidCprog
- 👀 I’m interested in a whole bunch of stuff I take advantage of my ADD/ADHD...
- 🌱 I’m currently retired working on anything that needs fixing
- MP3 players, Motorcycles, cars, laptops, code, etc.
- 💞️ I’m a bit rusty in C. I started with UNIX in the 80's.
- I did some programming in C for my BSEE, and as a hobby then.
- Currently enjoying LinuxMint and getting back into the UNIX thing.
- I'm somewhat of a jack of all trades master of none.
- 📫 I'll see how it goes, github for now.
